# Charitable - A Chrome browser extension to make charity easier via Amazon #

The extension itself is [published here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nblbmldigidmbimcmcamifcpmmmholbe)

### How do I get set up? ###

If you'd like to run the addon, use the link above please. If you'd like to build upon it, feel free to fork or see contribution guidelines below.

### Contribution guidelines ###

Feel free to submit PRs which will enable new countries or features--it seems that almost every locale of Amazon has a different setup. Any contributions will be welcomed!

### To-dos ###

* Flesh out the options page so it uses Chrome's built in memory sync
* Add more locales/languages
* Intercept requests which aren't directly to the homepage (this is somewhat more complicated and I have little free time to spend on this!)

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner or admin
